INT. GARAGE - DAY

BRICK and STEEL get into Mom's PORSCHE, Steel at the wheel.  They pause for a beat, the gravity of the situation catching up with them.

            BRICK
    This is everybody we've ever put away.

            STEEL
        (starting the engine)
    So much for retirement!

They speed off.  To destiny!
